**Naming Java files requires CapitalizedCamelCaseFormat**
**Variables are named using lowerCamelCase**
javac = java compiler
- compiles java code and turns it into bytecode, which will be found in a class file
- running javac HelloJava.java compiles the file, HelloJava
- running java HelloJava.java executes the compiled code
- javac command requires .java at the end
- java command DOES NOT

ALWAYS COMPILE YOUR CODE FIRST
- compile first with javac
- run button also works
- then run compiled code with java
- you have to compile it every time you make a change

**Data Types**
int = whole numbers (from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,648)

**Golden Rule**
- Use the smallest amount of memory possible.
